# obsidian-template

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) template that I use daily for work. It is based around the usage of the `templater` plugin to easily create new notes with the correct existing structure, and the dataview plugin to show relevant relation to other pages when searching for various concepts, projects and people.

My main goal with this template was to find a good comprise between a *folder-based* approach, and a *link-based* approach. I try to add as many links as possible between the concepts, making sure that notes are correctly linked to a Project, a Person, a Company, etc. This allows me to easily navigate between the notes, and to quickly find all notes related to a specific topic.

While strictly not necessary for Obsidian, I also create a folder per project, allowing me to easily archive a full project, and for easy sharing of all project notes with collegues. However, concepts, people and companies are all in the same `Knowledge` folder, as they are not project specific and can be reused across them.

## How to use

You can simply open the `notes/` folder as a vault in obsidian. When first opening the template, you will be asked to trust the installed plugins. 

The `QUICKSTART` file at the root of the obsidian workspace contains all information necessary to understand how to use Obisidan and this template.
